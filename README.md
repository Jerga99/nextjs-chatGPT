This is an example Next JS with ChatGPT integration app used in the Eincode Youtube Tutorial [youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/dmM83DhzE98).

2. Clone or download this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd nextJS-chatGPT
   ```

4. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

5. Create a ```.env``` file to setup API KEY to OpenAI (explained in the Course)

6. Add your [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file

```OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY ```

7. Run the app
